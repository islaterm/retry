This repository contains an implementation of the _Roussopoulos, Kelley & Vincent (RKV)_ nearest
neighbour algorithm for R-Trees.
For this purpose, the repository also contains an implementation of R-Trees based on the lectures
of **Iv√°n Sipiran** from his course on _Multimedia Databases_ (Department of Computer Sciences,
University of Chile).

This implementation was done as an assignment for the aforementioned course.

Consider that this project is still in development stage.
